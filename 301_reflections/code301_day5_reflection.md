# Wrapping up week one

In the morning I finished incorporating Handlebars into my portfolio and reorganizing my JavaScript data and logic into separate files. That meant a decent amount of code refactoring, so it took longer than I expected to get everything up and running. A big part my problem was the order in which I was loading my js files. The problem was that I was loading the script that created the object before loading the script containing the data used to create that object. Once again we go back to 'order matters'. Going to *try* and pay special attention to those details in the next few labs so that I am intentional about where I am placing code (which is a good practice for any file). In lecture we went over a few new concepts; I'm glad we started the pair programming assignment as a group so that I could understand what we were trying to accomplish but I plan to go over all the source code tonight or tomorrow because think it will really help me understand what the code we wrote does.
