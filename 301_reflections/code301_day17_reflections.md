# Day Two Down

Today we got right to work making our app meet MVP. We got connected to the two APIs correctly, figured out how to drop car images as pins, harvested all the coordinate data we need, and got the url parameters set up. It felt like we accomplished a lot today and we are really close to complete functionality. I'd like to look into making the user experience smoother but if we have all the pieces there I'll be happy for the moment.
