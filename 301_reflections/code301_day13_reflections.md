# Heroku

Today we learned about Heroku, which is a way to deploy your webpage other than GitHub pages. Interestingly it's basically outsourcing creating something through AWS, since what Heroku does to deploy your site is set up an AWS platform for you. Evidently that's pretty cumbersome though, which is why people are willing to pay a third party to not have to do it themselves (or pay their own engineer to do it). We're using the free version, which means that there could be a noticeable latency for our page load if a call hasn't been made in a while since the dyno will need to "wake up". For what scale we're building to though and our current audience that seems like it won't be much of an issue. I also finished setting up my M-V-C organization today and am pretty happy with how it came out. It's many more files but at least it's easy to tell exactly what the code in each file is related to and what it's purpose is.
