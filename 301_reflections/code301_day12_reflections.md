# Day 12

Today I understood what we learned yesterday and feel pretty good about the controller files and utilizing page.js. Talking it through with the TAs helped and I was able to complete the portfolio assignment for day 11 with minimal confusion after that. Doing the reading on HTTP I gave me a greater appreciation of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE; they actually seem like quite a powerful tool that are really taken for granted today. I also got the opportunity today to learn more about how to effectively get my foot in the door for interviews thanks to an amazing meetup organized by She's Coding. The most important thing I learned from the mock interview was through the whiteboarding problem we did and the feedback the interviewer provided. I got to see where my weaknesses are and got advice on how to approach problems & interview questions better.
