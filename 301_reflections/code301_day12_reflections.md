# Day 12

Today I understood what we learned yesterday and feel pretty good about the controller files and utilizing page.js. After talking through RESTful APIs I also feel like I understand those fairly well and after doing the reading on HTTP I have a greater appreciation of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. Big thing I learned today was actually from a meetup. Went through whiteboarding problem and got to see where my thought process is lacking and how to approach problems & interview questions better.
