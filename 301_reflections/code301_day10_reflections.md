# Functional Programming and Arrow Functions

Today we learned how to make our code much cleaner using arrow functions; they're great as long as you're not dealing with constructors or trying to use 'this'. I think I like always including the parenthesis around the argument though, even if there's only one. It makes it more consistent (even if the extra characters aren't necessary). I also learned about IIFEs (which you should not use arrow functions for, since it can get confusing with all those parenthesis). An IIFE is an immediately invoked function expression, which means that it gets called as soon as the page loads. What makes it special is that we can wrap it around all of our other functionality to give a certain level of privacy, which is cool. I'm sure it'll take time to get used to implementing it in my code but it'll be great to have a little more obscurity between my code and somebody who might want to mess with it.
