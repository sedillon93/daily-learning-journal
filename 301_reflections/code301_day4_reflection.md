# It's like learning to ride a bike

Today we started learning about & using Handlebars. That's a JavaScript library for templating. After our reading last night, and even for most of class today, I was confused about how it is more helpful than jQuery. You can use jQuery to add things to the DOM, so why not just do that? After seeing examples in class and working through the blog pair programming it makes more sense. While you have to take the time to write out the template in your HTML file to begin with, you then have access to that entire chunk using Handlebars. That means that you don't have to use jQuery at all to get elements and change the content. Instead, you just get the html of the template, compile the function using Handlebars, then fill in the template with whatever your content is. So for the lab today we ended up turning a dozen or so lines of code into four. I get the feeling that Handlebars is going to be a bit like eventListeners for me: no clue what I'm doing at first but with practice it'll be second nature.
