# Day 6: Can I offer you a meltdown with that cookie?

First off, nobody likes salmon cookies. Cookies shaped like salmon: yes, cookies made using salmon: no. That aside.

This lab felt like running into a brick wall as fast as you can, getting up, and doing it over and over. I got stuck repeatedly, sometimes making the same mistakes repeatedly. As lab went on I got more and more nervous that I wouldn't be able to complete it on time. Thankfully people are awesome and the whole group really helped each other work it through. And extra thankfully there's Nick, who literally looked at the code I'd been agonizing over, examined it for all of five seconds and told me what the issue was. After completing the lab I feel like I have a much better grasp on the concepts of manipulating the DOM and writing object literals. Now I'm just hoping tomorrow night I can feel as good as I do right now.
