#Day 3 Reflection: all about that CSS

Today we went over lists, loops, and logic (oh my!). Most of the content was familiar to me so I felt pretty comfortable. When we got to lab though I was surprised how much trouble I had figuring out how to write the loops correctly. I ended up having to take a step back, grab my notebook, and write out exactly what I wanted to do at a big picture and how to code that. Then I broke down any necessary chunks into the code needed to perform that operation. Ended up with some loops inside loops but it worked and really helped me understand what I needed to do. I should use my notebook from the beginning...

I got most of my page styled as I wanted, and Nick helped me figure out why my col-2 classes weren't working (curse you multiple class assignments!) Now I have my two columns for professional and personal stuff but I can't get the two divs vertically aligned. That might be a project for another day though since I've been stuck on it for a while and everyone else seems pretty busy right now.

Day three: finished! (except for the readings :()
