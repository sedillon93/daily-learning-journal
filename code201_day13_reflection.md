# Storing Things Locally

Order really matters in programming. You can have the right lines of code but if you do things out of order everything will break. I overheard a great analogy from one of my fellow 201 coders: "On line five you're saying 'clean all the floors in the building' on line ten you're saying 'create that building you cleaned all the floors of'. It doesn't make sense." It was so simple but a really powerful reminder to me about how essential it is to give a list of <em> properly ordered </em> steps. You can't clean any floors if the building doesn't exist, you can't store things in an array that isn't declared yet, and you can't change information stored locally if you don't retrieve it first. Always remember the order of steps of whatever you are trying to accomplish.
