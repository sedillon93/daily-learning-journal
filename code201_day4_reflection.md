# Day 4- Plays well with others?

Today we had our first pair coding assignment. We were randomly assigned partners and then given the task of putting all of the questions we had previously written into functions that would execute the same way. We spent quite a bit of time first trying to figure out how to do what we wanted to do. One of the TAs was very helpful and gave us some really useful advice: always write your code in English first, then translate it to your coding language. It helped me think about the smaller pieces of what we were trying to achieve. Once we got a plan together we were up and running, with some minor (yet frustrating) bugs here and there from typos. Overall though I feel like it went pretty well, and I learned a few shortcuts that I hadn't known before. I also learned to always, and I meant ALWAYS, call your function after you declare it and make your you have those closing brackets!
