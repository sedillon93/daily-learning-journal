# Slower progress but still moving forward

Today we finished up local storage using pair programming. Now everything is generally functional, but there are still some pieces that need to go in for it to be a good product. I realized today though that it is hard to try to preemptively code something. Yesterday Mike and I wrote the high score page function to create an object, store it in an array, and access an array that we planned to code today. Once we wrote that code today we realized that there was a lot of redundancy between the two pages and had to basically scrap the code from yesterday and just maintain the idea (change the physical code but keep the logic). It felt kind of crummy to have spent time on something that ultimately only caused confusion and slowed us down today. Henceforth I'll try to stick to a more linear progression of tasks.
