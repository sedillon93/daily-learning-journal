# Last Day of 201

Today was the final day of 201. We polished up code in the morning, practiced our presentation, and then just tried to keep ourselves from touching the code until the presentation. It was nice because it gave us an opportunity to blow off steam as a group, which I think we didn't do enough of during the project. Reflecting on this first course, I think that I've grown a lot as a coder and also personally. I'm sad to see the group disband because I feel like my classmates are a significant part of what made Code Fellows so amazing for me. Going forward, I'll try to remember what struck me during 201: always plan and communicate with your group, try your best to support your group mates, know your limits, and take time to build your team (and decompress) away from the computers.
