# Code 201 day 2 reflection

Today I spent a lot (read: too much) time trying to figure out how to make my background image transparent so that my About Me guessing game had normal text on a transparent background. I couldn't quite get it to work and decided to focus instead on my learning journal, the quiz, and readings. After a while two of the TAs helped me get the background to be more transparent by placing the image in the top of the body tag within the HTML file and then adjusting the img opacity. That worked for making it more transparent, but I had to do a lot of fiddling with the code to get the rest of the content overtop of the image. Plus now the page awkwardly scrolls down too far so that you can see a bunch of white space at the bottom. It's not quite what I'm aiming for but to be continued I guess...

I'm feeling much more comfortable with syntax in the different languages and GitHub too. It's a lot of fun to play around with but I want to get better at being more creative/inventive with my code. I feel like right now I'm going through the checklists and doing things I'm familiar with but not really branching into new territory. My goal for the next project is to try something new, even if it ends up not working.

Day two done!
