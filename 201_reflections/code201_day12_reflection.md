# Day 12- Charts

Actually creating the chart today was not my biggest challenge. I got stuck at the beginning because I made a typo in the dataset<em>s</em> part of the dataConfig of my chart. Once the typo was fixed the graph worked fine. The biggest challenge was reorganizing my code so that my image tags were created inside of divs. I went through three cycles of breaking and fixing that but feel good about it now. I still can't figure out how to get the product names lined up beneath the images but if I get time later this week I might try adding the names to their own div below where the images are rendered and only having them take up one third of the page. It's an idea I'll play with later but I'm excited that I keep wanting to come back to solve problems rather than getting frustrated and giving up. Mini victories is how I'm going to approach the rest of this course (and possibly programming in general).
