# Group Project and BusMall catalogue

Today we planned out our final project. It was good to go through the wireframing so that we all have an idea of what exactly it will look like; turns out we had each envisioned it a little differently so talking it through was very important. Now we are all on the same page and can start dividing up tasks and begin coding right away next week.

As for BusMall's order form and cart page, I got reminded that it is very important to add .value when you want the value of something from the event object and to step away from code if you've been staring at it for too long because you won't see the obvious fault in your logic in the code. Pay close attention because success is in the details, and if you have lost focus take a break.
