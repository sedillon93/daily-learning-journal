# Up and running

We accomplished a lot today. I helped set up the HTML structure for the game page and then got to work on the high score page with Mike. It was a great opportunity to practice many of the concepts we've learned lately: storing & retrieving arrays/objects in local storage, pulling properties from objects to create a new element, and using constructor functions. We also got to learn new things: we figured out how to sort an array of objects by one of the object properties. I also started the About Us page and played around with some fun JavaScript (making the pointer change during hover, changing what text appears when you hover, appending paragraphs only when the click event fires and removing the click event after one click). If the rest of the week is as good as today (knock on wood) it'll be an awesome way to finish my first course at CodeFellows.
