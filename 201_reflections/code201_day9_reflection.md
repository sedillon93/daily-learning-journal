# Day 9 Brain break (in a good way)

Today we reviewed what we did yesterday with events, event handlers, and event listeners. Things are making more sense but still not totally solid; I tried to add an event listener to something other than the form and couldn't figure out how to reference the correct pieces of information to make it work (targeting values user inputs into min cookie & max cookie fields). I'm also experimenting with sidebars because they seem cool and I want to make them work. I still don't like my customer facing pages but I think if I had more time (and focused on CSS rather than JS) I could make it look much better. But based on the designs I typically come up with on my own I think it's safe to say that I should find a site I like and use it for inspiration instead to prevent catastrophic ugly.
