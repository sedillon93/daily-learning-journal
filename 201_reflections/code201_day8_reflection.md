# Confusing events

I am beginning to understand events and event handlers but am still a bit confused about how accessing a specific value of a specific property of the event object works. I know the syntax and can logically see what it means, but I think it will just take more practice for it to start sinking in. I'm planning to reread that chapter on events this weekend and maybe do some extra research if I'm still confused after this weeks lab sessions.
