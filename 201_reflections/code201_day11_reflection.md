# Day 11- The start of BusMall

Today we started BusMall- like SkyMall but for buses. For some reason I had a lot of difficulty getting my pieces figured out. I knew that I needed a loop to create three elements to display the product images, but for most of lab I had no idea how to make sure that none of the images were replicated in the next round of the product testing. I also got really hung up on how to make sure that the user could only click on an item for 25 rounds and then see the product data. I feel like I made this lab much harder than it needed to be. I planned ahead of time but then realized as I was going that some items I'd listed as one step in the process could actually be broken down to five, which caused me extra trouble when I thought I was ready to move beyond that step. Tomorrow my goal is to think through very clearly exactly what the task is and what it means in English, then translate that into code.
