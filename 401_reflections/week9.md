## Last week of lecture in JS-401

This is the last week in lecture and I've really enjoyed getting to learn about OAuth and drag and drop. It's interesting to see what's readily available without even touching libraries or frameworks, let alone vanilla JS. I've had time to catch up on some readings too and do more prep before class which has been helpful. I have been quite stuck on the whiteboard problem we got yesterday; I have theoretical solutions I haven't been able to put into working code yet but I'm hoping I will figure out how to implement one of my solutions soon.
