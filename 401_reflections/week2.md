## Week 2 of 401JS

I am starting to understand how to set up a server very slowly. Concepts from 301 make more sense now in regards to what was going on behind the scenes but I am having difficulty implementing things on my own. That said, I can generally follow the "why" more than I could in 301 even if I can't necessarily do it myself yet. At least when I am lead through examples I can mostly follow along. I still feel like I am learning but it's frustratingly slow progress.
