Pros: I feel like I have opportunities to dive deep and really try to understand how the code works and why it needs to be written a certain way; Vinicio includes lots of examples during lecture which helps me understand concepts; I enjoy what I am learning and want to learn more.

Cons: I feel like I am already way behind what I should know; I get confused on simple things (for example, today I got confused about how to throw an error for one of my tests); I am still making very silly mistakes & not realizing that I've made them
