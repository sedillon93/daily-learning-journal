## Week 7 of 401JS

Redux for the win! I loved React last week and how easy it is to manage state (not to write the code to manage state, but at least to manage the app state). Now we get to skip a lot of the prop passing by adding in redux and it is fabulous. We've learned about actions, reducers, providers, and the store. Today we tried combined reducers which seems very helpful. I'm really enjoying the class and feel like I can follow along with how things are working for the most part. I'm getting confused in places when the flow gets complicated, particularly with going between components interacting with different reducers (like with the expense items); but overall it feels like a reasonable 'drinking from the firehose' level that Code Fellows has made feel relatively normal at this point.
