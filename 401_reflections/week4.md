# Week Four of JS 401

Since my last learning journal it's been a bit of a learning rollercoaster. There are times that I feel I am really understanding the concepts, but then when I go to implement them I find that I get confused by some details, or need to have things that seemed very clear in lecture reexplained. I have found that some things are coming more easily than they did at first. I think that I understand how to properly implement tests now, am getting better at debugging with the logs, and understand how the back-end we're building generally works. But then I run into situations where things I used to know at the end of week one or two seem to be fading, and I am worried that I will not be able to retain this knowledge without constant reiteration/usage. I hope that as we continue in the course I'll find that what we've covered becomes more solidified as we build on it, and I will continue trying to code things from scratch without relying on the sample code as much as I can.
