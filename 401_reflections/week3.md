# Week Three of JS 401

Things from week one and two are starting to solidify. Today I was better able to code the server from scratch without having to rely too much on the demo code Vinicio  wrote in class. I also feel like I am getting better at the whiteboard challenges: taking time to write pseudo-code and think through the problem before starting to write code. I have noticed that I still need to work on testing edge cases once I have implemented a solution, so that is something to continue working on. I am feeling positive about the progress I am making, and am excited about all the material we are covering and what it can do. I think I prefer the logic problems and data structures to building a server, but I think that's because I can get results faster. That said, I do like the end result of making the server.
