## Starting front-end

Since we're now in the second half of the course we are starting front-end and all I can say is woohoo! The back-end material was really interesting, and I feel like I understand how websites work much better, but I missed being able to see the code I wrote in action. In my experience it's a lot easier to tell if something is breaking on front-end than back-end, plus I love designing webpages. We're learning React to start and I can't believe how versatile it is! We're only on day three but we've already been able to dynamically render a few pages. Today we built a 'To Do' app. I needed help figuring out how to properly pass arguments between the modules due to the one direction flow so that state is only on the parent component, but I think it'll come easier with practice; even today I feel like by the time I finished the lab had clicked more. Can't wait to see what else React can do!
