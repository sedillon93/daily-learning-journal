#Code 201 day 2 reflection

Today I spent a lot (read: too much) time trying to figure out how to make my background image transparent so that my About Me guessing game had normal text on a transparent background. I couldn't quite get it to work and decided to focus instead on my learning journal, the quiz, and readings. I'm still very curious though so I'll keep trying to figure it out when I have more time and a less frazzled brain.

I'm feeling much more comfortable with syntax in the different languages and GitHub too. It's a lot of fun to play around with but I want to get better at being more creative/inventive with my code. I feel like right now I'm going through the checklists and doing things I'm familiar with but not really branching into new territory. My goal for the next project is to try something new, even if it ends up not working.

Day two done! Unless I go back to that background transparency issue...
